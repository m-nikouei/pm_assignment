What is the technical name for the stopper used to seal a barrel of beer or wine? Most fermenting vessels require a stopper to hold an airlock in place or seal it up while moving so what is the technical name of that stopper?The stopper is called a “bung”. The hole is called the bung hole.A bung, stopper or cork is a truncated cylindrical or conical closure to seal a container, such as a bottle, tube or barrel. Unlike a lid, which encloses a container from the outside without displacing the inner volume, a bung is partially inserted inside the container to act as a seal. - Bung (Wikipedia)Bung in the bunghole of a wine barrel

Is wine dryness or sweetness due to grape variety? What divides a dry wine from a sweet wine is the level of residual sugar left in the wine after fermentation? No, they are not related at all. Except when they are. Let me explain. There are a couple of ways to make a wine sweet. Ferment to dryness, filter and then add something sweet. Make a wine with so much sugar that the yeast can't finish Stop fermentation before it ends (filtering or alcohol) and leave some sweetness Almost all grapes can be made into sweet wine by one of these methods, but not all of them are as tasty as others. Some grapes, like Riesling, can make both an excellent sweet dessert style wine and a dry wine. Then others like Cabernet Sauvignon are rarely made into sweet wine. It has to do with the tannins. The one exception to this is Port and Madeira where they make sweet wines from red grapes but these are meant to age. So, to answer your question. No, sweet wines don't have to be related to a specific grape, but they are for taste purposes and not on the physical properties of the grapes. Sweetness largely depends on the level of residual sugar left in the wine after fermentation (which may be stopped in order to increase the sugar left). But it does not mean that all grape varieties have the same sweetness. Muscat grape is usually sweeter than other grapes. Please also note that adding sugar to must is strictly forbidden in Italy, except for sparkling wines.

How many hours to remove and install a Cherokee 180 engine and prop How many hours should it take a shop to remove, install, and adjust the engine in a Cherkee 180 with a fixed pitch prop. This would include the baffles and any hardware needed to be removed and installed for an engine swap. Thanks

Are there any safety or technical reason airlines do not display accurate flight information to passengers? A newer addition to commercial airliners is seatback screens, that allow the passengers to watch movies, TV, and so forth. On most airlines, there is also a map, that shows you the aircraft's flight path, position, airspeed, and altitude.I have noticed that the information displayed on the map screen only updates in roughly 15-second intervals. Is there any reason for this? I can't imagine that there would be any bandwidth limitation issue for such a small amount of text data (for example, I can drive a ton of data to my ForeFlight app with my relatively mid-range GA IFD), so I imagine there must be a safety or technical reason for it.

What area of Proxima Centauri would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable on Earth? One of ideas of how Breakthrough Starshot could communicate data from Proxima Centauri is to have a massive swarm of the solar sail powered craft to pivot (with their sails) synchronously, taking either 'sideways' or 'head on' orientation to the star - in effect either obstructing it or revealing for an observer 'behind' - on Earth. If the swarm is big enough, it would cause an observable dimming of the star - and timing the pivots right it could encode data in the star's visible luminosity. The primary question of viability of this idea lies in 'how big a swarm?'. What percentage, or what absolute area or a star like Proxima would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable? We can notice transition of exoplanets quite reliably so that would be the upper bound, but what's the smallest object area that would make a detectable difference?

How does gravity affect pressure under water? How different would being under water in Europa differ from being under water on Earth? Would it be possible to dive deeper on Europa with a submarine than on Earth and by how much? For a liquid, hydrostatic pressure is ?gh where ? is density (this is always the same for all water) g is gravitational acceleration and h is depth. The gravitational acceleration on Europa is 1.3 (compared with 9.8 on Earth). But on Europa there is 20km of ice floating on the water. As a rough estimate, the gravity in Europa is 1/10 that on Earth, so the pressure at the bottom of the ice/top of the water would be comparable to the pressure at 2km in the Earth's Oceans. Since we can build submarines that can operate at 10km, we could reasonably suppose that we could operate submarines down to about 100km on Europa, which takes us to the rocky surface. However we have no way to pass through 20km of ice crust to reach the water layer. Building the submarine may be the easy part!

How much cooler space is required for transporting an elk? In going on an elk hunt, how much space do I need to store the quarters and meat for transportation home? Obviously this depends on the size of the animal but how much cooler space should I plan on? Your going to want to debone it to pack it most efficiently into the coolers, otherwise the quarters are going to be too big and awkward to fit into the coolers and they are really heavy. Once deboned, place 20-25 lbs of meat into double bagged garbage bags for easier handling. From experience, something like a single 150 to 200 quart cooler will be enough, but you won't be able to lift the cooler. If you got two coolers it would probably take two full size adults to lift them. You could also put the bags in and take them out one at a time for easier handling. Per this video, it is recommended to have about 170 qts (160.88 litres) of cooler space for one elk. How Many Coolers to Get Your Elk Home, Randy Newberg explains? You can also use a medium sized freezer in your trailer instead of buying coolers. A cow elk filled up just about half of a 10 cu ft (0.28m cubed) freezer and kept things cool just fine. This also allows you to hook up a generator to it in case you have issues with getting ice.

Tent in the rain I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent bought 5 years ago and used three nights since (a shame I know). In any case, it was used for 4 nights camping in Spain in dry conditions and was an amazing tent. A few months ago went camping and it started raining. We set up the tent but stayed in a shelter next to our tent until it was time to hit the sack. After I opened the tent, there was quite some water all over our gear. It wasn't a pool but it wasn't something where we would want to spend the night. The tent is a double wall tent, been stored in dry conditions for the last 4 years of non use. In any case, my questions are as follows, if someone has any experience with this: 1) Is it possible that this can be caused because of condensation? No one was in the tent since we pitched it until we went back into the tent so somehow it feels odd that the condensation would form in such an amount. 2) The fabric seems to be leaking when I put it under water at home. Is this normal? I live in an apartment and don't have the opportunity to do the hose test, but I took the rain fly into the shower and opened the shower. After a while the fabric started being most on the inside and forming tiny bubbles of water. 3) During the testing I did to the tent, it seems that when I'm pouring water over the tent and the rain fly is touching the pole of the tent, water seems to go through at these spots in large quantities. Is this normal for a tent? I only owned canvas tents before so unfortunately I have nothing to compare to, but would like to know how you handle these conditions as now I'm afraid to take the tent for my next hike. I emailed the manufacturer but haven't received a reply since August 1) Is it possible that this can be caused because of condensation? How wet your gear and tent floor was? If it's just slightly damp on the outside then this is perfectly normal in wet air conditions (think foggy, wet air or long moderate rain, close to 100% humidity). The tent is designed to allow air (and moisture in it unfortunately) to circulate. If it's anything above slightly damp then the tent probably leaked slightly. 2) The fabric seems to be leaking when I put it under water at home. Is this normal? Yes, I don't know a tent that's going to stop a direct, slightly pressurized water stream from a shower :). What you describe sounds like normal behaviour to me. As long as you don't observe the water dripping down from the outer fly onto the inner during a rain you're fine. If you want to redo the test I'd pitch the tent in a park / forest and use a watering can to pour water on different spots of the tent and check for leaks. That way you get a stream of water that falls driven by wind and gravity - closer to what rain is. 3) During the testing I did to the tent, it seems that when I'm pouring water over the tent and the rain fly is touching the pole of the tent, water seems to go through at these spots in large quantities. Again, this unfortunately is normal. Rain fly leaks really quickly if something is touching it from the inside. This is why it's very important to pitch the tent correctly and make the rain fly taut. If you expect heavy wind or rain it is also a good idea to use the guy lines.

One cat doesn't understand the other is just play-fighting My girlfriend and I have two three-year-old cats: Napoleon (male) and Josefine (female). They are siblings from the same litter. I have been studying abroad for the last 9 months, so currently my girlfriend's the one taking care of them. The two cats get along just fine for the vast majority of the day. They eat together, the female frequently bathes the male (though baths usually become a small fight for some reason, and she really doesn't like it when he tries to bathe her), and my girlfriend sends me pictures (and videos) of the cats sleeping cuddling together in the most adorable ways at least once a week. However, whenever the two play together, Napoleon seems to have a hard time understanding the boundaries of acceptable behavior and takes things a bit too far. It doesn't help that Napoleon is significantly larger (1 kg = 2 lb heavier even though they're the same age) than Josefine, and that she sometimes honestly seems to ask for it. As a representative example, please watch this 45-second video. Josefine waits to ambush Napoleon as he leaves the bathroom (where we keep their sandbox) and gives him a light tap on the head (I interpret this as a play-ambush). He gets seemingly startled and then the situation momentarily escalates (but not severely), followed by Josefine becoming slightly submissive (hunching down) and letting out long, trembling meows as both seemingly vie for an opportunity to strike. Napoleon then lets out some meows of his own and Josefine becomes very submissive, lying down. The video ends there, and my girlfriend says that's when she interrupted the fight by calling their attention. In similar situations when she hasn't stopped them (she usually lets them solve things out for themselves), Napoleon will go for a bite or something of the sort, Josefine will bat him away and run away, at which point Napoleon will sometimes give chase. If he does, the fight continues with more jabs and some biting. Nails always remain sheathed and the bites don't seem to be meant to injure (no one's ever come out bleeding, shall we say). Sometimes we just see the chase and don't see the instigating incident (or whether there was one), but Josefine seems to be the usual initial instigator. Other times the cats play "tag", running around the house with no issue. Once the fights are over, the cats don't seem to avoid each other or anything indicating lasting animosity. That being said, one time (and only one time that we're aware of) Napoleon did end up with a tuft of Josefine's hair in his mouth. Since neither cat seems very affected by the fights, my girlfriend usually doesn't interrupt them. That being said, we'd rather stop this behavior or at least understand it better. Is this actually just normal play-fighting (and the time Napoleon got a mouthful of hair was then just a one-off accident/escalation) to be shrugged off? Is our interpretation of Josefine's behavior incorrect, and she isn't play-fighting at all? Or, if we are correct in our diagnosis that Napoleon simply doesn't know how to play-fight, is there some way to teach him to turn it down a notch? For some further context into our cats' recent history and how their behaviors changed (quite significantly) after I left to study, please see this other question I asked 7 months ago. This type of fighting also only started after I left, so that context might be relevant. (Also note that the issue raised in that question has passed) As a representative example, please watch this 45-second video. From my reading of this video: J is playing. N is genuinely annoyed. J makes herself small to goad N into playing with her. It's not so much a matter of submission as more giving N the high ground so he's more inclined to actually pounce. N, on the other hand, is making himself large to show that he is unhappy with her ambushing him. This is a clear miscommunication. J reads N's behavior as being goaded into playing, when in fact he is scolding her for ambushing him. N reads J's behavior as admitting she made a mistake, when in fact she is trying to urge him to play together. Josefine will bat him away and run away, at which point Napoleon will sometimes give chase. If he does, the fight continues with more jabs and some biting. Nails always remain sheathed and the bites don't seem to be meant to injure (no one's ever come out bleeding, shall we say). Their actions here are consistent with a cat that actually chooses to join in the playing. We see this happen all the time in our house. The youngest of the three, incessantly playful, used to pounce on his sisters to start a play session, but they did not like that (and he would be driven out of the room). After a while, the youngling learned that instead of pouncing, he instead made himself look weak and thus lured his sisters into playing with him. If they responded, that means they wanted to play. If they didn't, then they don't want to play but at least he didn't upset them. Given that there are no nails or hard bites, how sure are you that Napoleon is fighting with her and not play fighting? This may be on a cat-by-cat basis, but we've noticed that it's only a fight when someone hisses. Anything before that is fair game. We can gauge this by the cats' reaction when we call out. If both of them stay there, it was a play session. If one of them makes a hasty retreat, they were an unwilling participant. If N genuinely can't handle J's playfulness, you should provide J with more toys or playsessions with you so she can get her energy out. But otherwise, just letting them solve it themselves is the better solution as long as no one gets hurt or aggravated.

Large DIY Dissassemblable Cat Cage? In order to bring a cat to university as an emotional support animal, the school is requiring me to keep the cat in a cage while I'm not in the room. I don't think this is fair to the cat, but since I have no choice, I'm wondering: How is the best way to make a large cat cage that I can take apart and put back together if need be? Would it make sense to get a couple of cat cages (read: the black metal wire ones) and put them together with some duct tape?
